This repository contains the source files for a two part peer-graded assignment for the Developing Data Products course as part of the Data Science Specialization offered through Coursera from Johns Hopkins University.

###Part 1
Create a Shiny application and deploy it on RStudio's servers.

Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.

Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server

Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box

Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

###Part 2
